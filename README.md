outseek - assist editing long videos by correlating its timeline with various sources of metadata

WIP - under active development, and not really useful for anything yet.

Automatic nightly builds are available for [windows x64](https://nightly.link/Felk/outseek/workflows/publish/main/outseek-win-x64.zip).

You currently need to have VLC media player (64-bit) installed in the default location (`C:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC`)
because it does not get bundled to achieve a smaller file size and faster startup time.
