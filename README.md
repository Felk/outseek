![screenshot](resources/screenshot-2021-05-13.png)

WIP - under active development, and not really useful for anything yet.

Automatic nightly builds are available for
- [windows x64](https://nightly.link/Felk/outseek/workflows/publish/main/outseek-win-x64.zip)
- [linux x64](https://nightly.link/Felk/outseek/workflows/publish/main/outseek-linux-x64.zip)

You currently need to have VLC media player (64-bit) installed because it does not get bundled to achieve a smaller file size and faster startup time.
- Windows: VLC is expected to be installed in the default location (`C:/Program Files/VideoLAN/VLC`)
- Linux: libvlc is expected to be available as a system library, e.g. by installing it through `sudo apt-get install vlc libvlc-dev`
